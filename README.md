# Golang microservice course

This project is a rewritten version of the  **Introduction to industry REST microservices in Golang (Go)** course from Federico Leon (Udemy). The course uses MVC, but I wanted to learn more about the Hexagonal architecture so i have rewritten the whole course and trying to apply the HEX architecture.


# Frameworks used

Gin, testify, zap

# Why this course?

This was my first longer GO course. I wanted to learn go rest api's a bit deeper, and also learn about micro services.
